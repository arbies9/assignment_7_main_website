                <p>Hello! I'm a senior at Queens College, majoring in Computer Science with an anticipated graduation in Fall '23. The world of software engineering beckons to me, not just because Iâ€™m drawn to the intricacies of code but also because I have an innate desire for challenges and an undying thirst for knowledge. When I'm not diving into algorithms and data structures, you can probably find me experimenting with a new recipe in the kitchen, embarking on thrilling travel adventures, or engrossed in a gripping video game. I'm an avid movie buff, and nothing beats the adrenaline rush from a good car meet. My commitment to the community resonates through my volunteering endeavors at my local mosque. I believe life is a blend of continuous learning and quality downtime, and I aim to strike that balance every day.</p>
